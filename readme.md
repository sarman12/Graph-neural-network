This project provides a graph-based structure for representing EEG data, leveraging node features, edge indices, and edge attributes. The graphs are constructed to enable analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) such as GCN, GAT, and GraphSAGE.

## Graph Structure Overview

For each subject, the EEG data is structured as a graph with nodes, edges, and features. Below is the graph information for one subject:

- **Number of Nodes:** 19
- **Number of Edges:** 171
- **Node Feature Shape:** [19, 6]
- **Edge Index Shape:** [2, 171]
- **Edge Attribute Shape:** [171, 6]
- **Graph Label:** 2

### Detailed Components

- **Nodes** represent EEG channels, with each node containing 6 features corresponding to specific frequency bands.
- **Edges** connect pairs of EEG channels and capture inter-channel coherence as edge attributes.
- **Edge Attributes** have a shape of `[171, 6]`, with each edge attribute containing 6 values, representing coherence values across bands.

## Models

This project includes three GNN models for graph classification tasks:
1. **GCN (Graph Convolutional Network)**
2. **GAT (Graph Attention Network)**
3. **GraphSAGE**

## Early Stopping and Model Selection

Each model utilized early stopping to prevent overfitting, and the final test accuracy was recorded after early stopping was triggered.

## Conclusion

GraphSAGE performed the best on this EEG classification task, achieving a test accuracy of 71.31% and strong F1-scores across various psychiatric disorder categories. This suggests that GraphSAGEâ€™s sampling-based approach may be more effective for this EEG dataset compared to GCN and GIN.
